# Pomodoro App with Flutter and Rive Animations

This repository contains the code for a Pomodoro app developed with Flutter and Rive animations. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages people to work with the time they have, rather than against it.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Rive**: A powerful design and animation tool that allows designers and developers to create interactive animations and vector graphics for web, mobile, and other platforms.
